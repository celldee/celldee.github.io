      <description>I have tried a number of Linux distros over the years and most recently was happily using Ubuntu 16.04 when I decided to give my laptop a complete revamp. Having read about tiling window managers a while ago, I had already installed i3 and was pleased with the results. But then I read about NixOS and Wayland which prompted the thought - could I install NixOS and a Wayland window manager as the basis of a usable but stripped down set up?</description>
